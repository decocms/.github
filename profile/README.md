## The Problem

Your teams are building impressive AI demos in Lovable, Replit, and n8n. But they never reach production.

**Why?** The Context Gap.

- 🔓 **Shadow AI Sprawl** — 20+ different auth tokens, no audit trails
- 💸 **Context Obesity** — Bloated prompts costing thousands, delivering confused answers  
- 🔁 **Integration Hell** — Rebuilding the same Salesforce connection for every agent

Agents hallucinate because they lack unified access to enterprise data. IT locks down access because they lack visibility into what AI is doing.

---

## The Solution: decoCMS

**decoCMS** is an open-source Context Management System for platform teams. Connect tools and data via MCP, enforce access and policy, and ship agentic software that teams can trust.

### 🧱 MCP Mesh
**Foundation**

A secure, observable control plane for MCP traffic.

One endpoint for all MCP servers with policy enforcement, audit trails, and multiple runtime strategies.

## Architecture at a Glance

| Layer | Purpose | What It Is | What You Do |
|-------|---------|------------|-------------|
| **MCP Mesh** | Infrastructure | Gateway + Runtime + Control Plane | Connect systems, enforce policies, monitor, debug |
| **MCP Studio** | Development | No-code admin + Full-code SDK | Create MCP apps, test on the mesh |
| **MCP Store** | Distribution | Marketplace for MCP capabilities | Discover, install, and monetize apps |

## Why MCP?

We're built on the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) standard — aligned with Anthropic and OpenAI architectural patterns.

- **Open & Portable** — Self-host on Kubernetes, deploy on-prem, or use our cloud
- **Composable** — Swap models, swap tools, swap agents. The Mesh remains your constant
- **No Lock-in** — Your context, your infrastructure. Audit the code, fork if needed

---

## Quick Start

```bash
npx @decocms/mesh init
```

→ One command to spin up your local MCP Mesh

## The Category: Context Management

Most "AI platforms" optimize prompts. AI-native companies optimize **context**.

Better context produces better outputs — and outcomes create new context.

decoCMS is built for closed-loop systems: instrument every call, learn what works, and improve routing/retrieval/execution over time.
